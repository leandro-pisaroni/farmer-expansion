Farmers' Market Expansion\n<p>You have been hired by a farming organisation that helps local farmers sell their products. They want to know whether they should open up a new farmers' market to sell dairy products from nearby farmers. They have supplied you with daily shopping data from a panel of local households from 2019 to 2020. </p>\n<p>The organization will make their decision based on whether dairy products are popular in the area, and whether sales are trending in a positive direction. To answer these questions, they want three pieces of data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What was the total number of purchases of dairy products for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>total_sales</code>)?</li>\n<li>What was the total share of dairy products (out of all products purchased) for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>market_share</code>)?</li>\n<li>For each month of 2020, what was the percentage increase or decrease in total monthly dairy purchases compared to the same month in 2019 (i.e., the <code>year_change</code>)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The organization handles not only dairy farmers, but also those with chicken farms. As a result, they are only interested in these three categories (which they treat as dairy): ‘whole milk’, 'yogurt' and 'domestic eggs'.</p>\n<p>The data you need is available in the tables shown in the database schema below.</p>\n<h5 id=\"databaseschema\">Database Schema</h5>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5960/datasets/463543c8c38957ca5b95d93b02f2cb1bec53334f/diagram.PNG\" alt=\"Database Schema\" width=\"400px\"></p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%sql\npostgresql:///groceries\n\nWITH dairy_sales_2020 AS(\n    SELECT\n        CAST(DATE_PART('month', CAST(fulldate AS DATE)) AS integer) AS month,\n        COUNT(*) AS dairy_2020\n    FROM purchases_2020\n    INNER JOIN categories\n    ON purchaseid = purchase_id\n    WHERE LOWER(category) IN ('whole milk', 'yogurt', 'domestic eggs')\n    GROUP BY month\n),\nmarket_sales_2020 AS(\n    SELECT\n        CAST(DATE_PART('month', CAST(fulldate AS DATE)) AS integer) AS month,\n        COUNT(*) AS market_2020\n    FROM purchases_2020\n    INNER JOIN categories\n    ON purchaseid = purchase_id\n    GROUP BY month\n),\ndairy_sales_2019 AS(\n    SELECT\n        month,\n        COUNT(*) AS dairy_2019\n    FROM purchases_2019\n    INNER JOIN categories\n    USING (purchase_id)\n    WHERE LOWER(category) IN ('whole milk', 'yogurt', 'domestic eggs')\n    GROUP BY month\n)\n    \nSELECT\n    CAST(ds20.month AS integer),\n    CAST(ds20.dairy_2020 AS integer) AS total_sales,\n    ROUND(CAST(ds20.dairy_2020 AS NUMERIC)/ms.market_2020*100,2) AS market_share,\n    ROUND((CAST(ds20.dairy_2020 AS NUMERIC) - ds19.dairy_2019)/ds19.dairy_2019*100,2) AS year_change\nFROM dairy_sales_2020 AS ds20\nINNER JOIN market_sales_2020 AS ms\nUSING (month)\nINNER JOIN dairy_sales_2019 AS ds19\nUSING (month)\nORDER BY month;","execution_count":119,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"12 rows affected.\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":119,"data":{"text/plain":"[(1, 228, Decimal('12.47'), Decimal('48.05')),\n (2, 165, Decimal('11.11'), Decimal('5.10')),\n (3, 216, Decimal('12.05'), Decimal('27.81')),\n (4, 218, Decimal('13.09'), Decimal('26.01')),\n (5, 195, Decimal('11.40'), Decimal('17.47')),\n (6, 196, Decimal('10.94'), Decimal('20.99')),\n (7, 195, Decimal('11.85'), Decimal('-0.51')),\n (8, 231, Decimal('11.77'), Decimal('32.00')),\n (9, 180, Decimal('11.16'), Decimal('4.65')),\n (10, 193, Decimal('11.61'), Decimal('17.68')),\n (11, 223, Decimal('12.55'), Decimal('36.81')),\n (12, 162, Decimal('10.42'), Decimal('8.72'))]","text/html":"<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>month</th>\n            <th>total_sales</th>\n            <th>market_share</th>\n            <th>year_change</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1</td>\n            <td>228</td>\n            <td>12.47</td>\n            <td>48.05</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>2</td>\n            <td>165</td>\n            <td>11.11</td>\n            <td>5.10</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>3</td>\n            <td>216</td>\n            <td>12.05</td>\n            <td>27.81</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>4</td>\n            <td>218</td>\n            <td>13.09</td>\n            <td>26.01</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>5</td>\n            <td>195</td>\n            <td>11.40</td>\n            <td>17.47</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>6</td>\n            <td>196</td>\n            <td>10.94</td>\n            <td>20.99</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>7</td>\n            <td>195</td>\n            <td>11.85</td>\n            <td>-0.51</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>8</td>\n            <td>231</td>\n            <td>11.77</td>\n            <td>32.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>9</td>\n            <td>180</td>\n            <td>11.16</td>\n            <td>4.65</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>10</td>\n            <td>193</td>\n            <td>11.61</td>\n            <td>17.68</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>11</td>\n            <td>223</td>\n            <td>12.55</td>\n            <td>36.81</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>12</td>\n            <td>162</td>\n            <td>10.42</td>\n            <td>8.72</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>"},"metadata":{}}]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.7","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
